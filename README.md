Hi!
I have recently added the virtual environment whatsappgroup. 

For windows, go to the cmd, and the path where the virtual environment is located. 

Type: (name of virtual environment)\Scripts\activate
Next, type python script.py to run the main program.

Please change the username and path in the config.py file based on your platform.
It will ensure that you do not have to scan the QR more than twice. 
If it shows the user data direction is not unique error, you need to go to the directory where user data
is situated and delete the Wtsp folder. 
Please refer to the config.py file for more details. 

If script.py quits unexpectedly, check your internet connectivity. 
As the task is to automate the browser, the program is susceptible to network fluctuations. Please try again. 

Feel free to report any issues and queries.
